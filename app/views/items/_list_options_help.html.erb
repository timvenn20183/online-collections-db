This sections allows you to decide what fields / values will be shown when viewing a list of items. Lists of items are available when you select a collection, condition or other field options that you may have created. You can limit the views to a single name or expand it to include a brief overview and picture of the item. Any item which has a blank value for a given field will mean that the field is automatically not shown.
