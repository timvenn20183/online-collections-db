The rolodex section is the list of people, companies, publishers, authors etc. that are involved in some way or another with the items in your collection. Each item may have as many of rolodex entries associated with it and you can choose to include a rolodex entry on the main menu. An example, such as the donation of a book to your collection, would be to add the donar, author and publisher to the rolodex list and associate them with the book.
