                        This is the vintage / retro computer and games collection of Tim Venn and has been keeping me facinated for the past 10 years. The collection covers systems from various manufacturers over a period of more than 35 years and ranges from machines, consoles, games, software, magazines and books to just about any other retro or vintage computing related items. Over the past year I have also started to include the more recent consoles into the collection.

                        The hobby of vintage computer and console collecting is still taking hold in South Africa with many collecting consoles from their youth. Call it nostalgia but many South Africans are turing to the local papers and auction sites to buy back a piece of their youth. For those wanting to dispose of those "junk items" around the house, but not wanting to throw them away, there is now a home for those unwanted dinosaurs and space hogs. That home is here.

                        No collection would be complete if it didn't contain the history of companies that made it possible for these amazing items to have arrived and be distributed here in South Africa. As such this website is also dedicated to collecting the history and stories of those people and companies. If you feel you have a story to tell I am always available to listen.

My initial experiences with computers involved an early IBM PC 5150 and hence a fair amount of my collection is dedicated to IBM systems and DOS. I enjoy collecting, restoring and playing with these old systems. When time permits I also have an interest in electronics with the hopes of building a Z80 single board computer and arcade cabinet sometime in the future. People often ask me some of the following questions :
