This site uses the concept of tags. The tags provide a flexible way to identify items and mark them. T
ags can be anything from identifiers of the conditions (e.g. "Hard Cover" or "Soft Cover") to the type
 of item (e.g. for games consoles tags such as "PS3" or "Atari 2600" can be used to identify the type
of console). From these tags it will be possible to group items and also search for items.
