This is where you can add "virtual collections" of items. The concept here is to provide a way to grou
p items which belong together and which you want to present in a grouping. Examples of this would be b
ooks. A book could be a hard cover or soft cover book and hence you could create both a hard and soft
cover collection. When working with items you will be able to assign any number of these collections t
o the item you are working with.
